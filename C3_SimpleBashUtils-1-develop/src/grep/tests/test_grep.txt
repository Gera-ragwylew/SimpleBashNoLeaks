We live in a 12-story building in the central part of the city.
Let me tell you about our apartment.
We live on the second floor, so usually we do not use the elevator. 
There 2 are four rooms in the apartment – my parents’ room, my little brother’s room, the room where I live, and the living room. 
There 3 are also, of course, a cozy kitchen and a bathroom.

The kitchen is small, but, as I said before, quite cozy. 
There 1 is a stove, fridge, kettle, microwave, table and chairs there. 
We also have a lot of kitchen utensils such as knives, ladles and so on. 
There is my mom’s portrait hanging on the wall. 
The portrait is very good, my father drew it many years ago when they met.
